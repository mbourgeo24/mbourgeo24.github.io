											<p>My name is Michael and I live in the Bay Area. Originally I am from about 15 minutes north of Boston, MA.
										My interest in programming developed while I was in the United States Air Force working for a think-tank named Phoenix Spark.
										The first program that I wrote was to turn LED lights off and on using Python and a Raspberry PI.  After that I became hooked!.
										My goal is to be able to learn enough to leverage technologies to create complex back-end applications. Some of my interests 
										include investing and bodybuilding which I think is a good Catalyst for programming. In both you have to be incredibly patient 
										and consistent to see any form of improvement. You'll see some of my favorite projects that I've worked on showcased here!</p>

								<h1>Career Experience</h1>
									<li>
										<li>2014 - 2016 Keller Williams Real Estate Agent</li>	
											<p>This job had some of the most valuable lessons and best experiences to date. <br> I loved
											managing my own business and learning the soft skills that you really can't get anywhere else. <br>Learning the value of 
										    communication and relations really has helped me everywhere else in life. I left to join the military, otherwise I would be doing this full-time today. </p>
										<li>2015 - 2016 Store Manager at General Nutrition Corner </li>
											<p>Managing a business that is run by yourself is one thing, however, managing others is entirely different. <br>
											My main responsbilities included but not limited to hiring staff, managing expenses, and most importantly marketing the brand<br> Some of my 
										    favorite times working here was doing local community events such as making goodie bags for schools or setting up booths at gyms.</p>
										<li>2016 - 2021 United States Air Force</li>
											<p>My time in the military was definitely an experience. The Air Force taught me a lot of skills that are may be foreign to some in todays climate.<br>
											The most important one is discipline and resilliency. Before joining the military I did have the experience I listed above, but I was missing the 
											maturity and manners that come with serving. If I could do it all over I would still join the Air Force again. I worked as a medical administrator and my 
										    state-side tasks included coordinating patient schedule and maintaining the systems in our clinic. I was essentially a generalist. </p>
